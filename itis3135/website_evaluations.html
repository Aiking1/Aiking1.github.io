    <p>The following website Evaluations are besided of the following <a href="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f356b9cde602d320eaee4b2/1702046321541-J6ANBHP2WVEJQVO4X2M2/Screen+Shot+2023-12-08+at+9.35.50+AM.png" target="_blank">CRAP</a> principles when designing a webpage.</p>
    
    <h3><a href="https://www.delta.com/" target="_blank">Delta Airlines</a></h3>
<p>Delta Airlines' website is a great example of clean, modern design. It’s easy to navigate, visually appealing, and makes booking flights or checking in a smooth process.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>C - ontrast:</strong> The colors, fonts, and layout create a clear and professional look. Important elements stand out, making it easy to find what you need.</li>
    <li><strong>R - epetition:</strong> The site maintains a consistent style throughout, from navigation menus to buttons and typography.</li>
    <li><strong>A - lignment:</strong> Everything is well-organized in a structured grid, ensuring a balanced and readable design.</li>
    <li><strong>P - roximity:</strong> Related information, like flight booking options and travel details, are grouped logically, making the site intuitive to use.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, Delta’s site does a fantastic job following CRAP principles, creating a smooth and professional user experience.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.lingscars.com/" target="_blank">Ling's Cars</a></h3>
<p>Ling’s Cars is... an experience. The website is loud, cluttered, and full of flashing graphics, making it overwhelming to navigate.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>C - ontrast:</strong> There’s a lot of it—but not in a good way. Bright, clashing colors and excessive animations make it hard to focus.</li>
    <li><strong>R - epetition:</strong> There’s little consistency. Fonts, colors, and layout styles change randomly across the pages.</li>
    <li><strong>A - lignment:</strong> The content is all over the place, with no real structure or grid to guide the eye.</li>
    <li><strong>P - roximity:</strong> Everything feels crammed together with little spacing, making it difficult to process information.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ling’s Cars is a perfect example of what <strong>not</strong> to do when designing a website. It’s fun in a chaotic way, but it completely ignores CRAP principles, making for a frustrating user experience.</p>
