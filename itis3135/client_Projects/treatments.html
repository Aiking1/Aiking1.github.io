                <h4>Bridges</h4>
                <p>Bridges are used when a tooth is missing to fill in an empty space. The dentist uses teeth on either side of the space as supports for the bridge. Crowns are placed on these teeth and these crowns are connected with false teeth in the empty spaces. All the bridge is a single piece, and it is usually put in place with special dental "glues" that hold the bridge in place.</p>

                <h4>Dentures</h4>
                <p>While Implants and Bridges are currently experiencing greater popularity due to their increased stability, ease of maintenance, and exceptional cosmetic results, Dentures provide a perfectly acceptable means of replacing missing teeth for budget-conscious patients.</p>

                <h4>Implants</h4>
                <p>Surgically placed below the gums over a series of appointments, implants fuse to the jawbone and serve as a base for individual replacement teeth, bridges or a denture. Implants offer stability because they fuse to your bone. Integration of the implants into your jaw also helps your replacement teeth feel more natural and some people also find the secure fit more comfortable than conventional substitutes.</p>

                <h4>Fillings</h4>
                <p>Dentists have been using silver fillings for years. While there is nothing wrong with the silver filling material, many people today are opting to have cavities filled with tooth-colored material. It looks better and, with the improvements in the strength of the new materials, they work well in areas where there are lots of chewing and biting pressure</p>

                <h4>Crowns</h4>
                <p>Crowns restore tooth structure while simultaneously improving its appearance. Additionally, crowns can be used to attach a bridge, protect a weak tooth from breaking or restore one that's already broken. A crown is a good way to cover teeth that are discolored or badly shaped.</p>
