    Contract
I, <i>Isaac A. King</i> agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my <i>Spring 2025</i>,<i>ITIS 3135</i>, <i>Web-Based Application Design &amp; Development</i> with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen. I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools 
 will be available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private. I also understand 
 that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences. I also understand
  that given the structure and content of this class it’s possible to find many examples online or even view my classmates’ code directly. I swear that I will only 
  use these resources to learn, and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates. 
  Signed: <i> Isaac A. King, 02/03/2025</i>
