         <p>Hunting has been an integral part of human history and culture for thousands of years. From ancient civilizations to modern-day hunters, the act of hunting big game is deeply rooted in tradition, survival, and cultural heritage. This section explores the people who hunt, their connection to the land, and the ongoing legacy of big game hunting around the world.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Indigenous and Tribal Cultures:</strong> Many indigenous peoples have a rich history of hunting, relying on big game for sustenance, clothing, and spiritual rituals. These practices are often passed down through generations, with a deep respect for nature and animal spirits.</li>
            <li><strong>Conservationists and Ethical Hunters:</strong> Modern hunters play a crucial role in conservation efforts, particularly in regions with threatened or endangered species. Big game hunting, when done ethically and within regulated frameworks, helps fund wildlife protection initiatives and promotes biodiversity.</li>
            <li><strong>Big Game Hunters and Sportsmen:</strong> The modern sport of big game hunting attracts individuals seeking adventure, challenge, and the connection to nature. For many, hunting is a way to immerse themselves in the wilderness, learn about different ecosystems, and engage in a longstanding tradition that goes back centuries.</li>
        </ul>

            <figcaption>A "big game kill" typically referred to the hunting and killing of large, dangerous animals like elephants, lions, buffalo, rhinoceroses, and bearsâ€”animals that posed a challenge due to their size, strength, and the skill required to hunt them. These animals were often seen as the pinnacle of hunting achievement.</figcaption>

         <h2>When to Hunt</h2>
        <!-- h2 tag telling the user the  purpose of this section include 3 things with one with one being fig -->

        <p>When you have made the proper preparation and are ready to go hunting.</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Twilight, Sunrise, &amp; Sunset</strong> - These are the feeding and movement times for many species. Around 30 minutes before sunrise and 30 minutes after sunset.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Weather</strong> - Windy conditions can affect your shot and make hunting more difficult. Scent detection can also play a part, making it either easier or harder depending on circumstances.
        <br>
        <strong>Fronts</strong> - Most animals are more active before and after a cold front to prepare for the weather or come out and look for food.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Moon Phases</strong> - Full moons often lead to more nighttime activity, while new moons may result in animals being more active during daylight hours.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Post Storm</strong> - Animals tend to be more active after a storm or a heavy rain, as they come out to forage.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Hunting Seasons</strong> - Hunting is regulated to specific seasons ensuring wildlife conservation and population control. These seasons vary by region, species, and local laws. An example of this is, deer hunting season typically occurs in the fall, while turkey hunting has separate spring and fall seasons.
    </li>
</ul>
